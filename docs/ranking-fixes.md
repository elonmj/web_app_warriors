# Ranking System Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. Matches file analysis shows completed and validated matches that should be included in rankings
2. RankingService.ts has incorrect imports and validation status checks:
   - Wrong import path for ValidationStatus
   - Using enum syntax for string literal types
   - Need to update validation status checks to match the type definition

3. RatingSystem.ts has TypeScript errors about missing properties:
   - Need to verify property access matches Match type definition
   - Need to ensure PlayerStatistics interface implementation is complete

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix RankingService.ts
- Update import to use ValidationStatus from '@/types/ValidationStatus'
- Replace enum-style status checks with string literals:
  ```typescript
  // Current
  match.result.validation.status === ValidationStatus.VALID
  
  // Update to
  match.result.validation.status === 'valid'
  ```

### 2. Fix RatingSystem.ts
- Review Match type definition
- Update property references to match type structure
- Implement missing PlayerStatistics interface properties

### 3. Test Changes
- Test ranking calculation with existing matches
- Verify correct points allocation
- Ensure proper validation status handling

## Expected Outcome
- Rankings should be correctly calculated and stored in rankings JSON file
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Proper handling of match validation statuses
